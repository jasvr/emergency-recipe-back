# Emergency Recipe (Back End)

Emergency Recipe (ER) flips recipe search on it's head â€“ allowing users to search for recipes by the ingredients they already have in hand.

## Getting Started

The ER backend was developed with Express, Node and MongoDB to work in conjunction with the Emergency Recipe Front End app (which was evelped in React), providing an API of recipes was built using Express.js, as a class project for the 28th instance of Web Development Immersive at General Assembly in Washington, DC.

To play around with it, feel free to access it on the web at (URL TK).

To tinker under the hood, feel free to fork and clone this repository.

### Prerequisites

We've worked to keep this project fairly light on the dependency front. However, a few packages required.

```
npm i
```

### Installing

Once you've forked and cloned the repository, it's easy to get started.

```
npm run start
```

That should kick off a new tab in your browser connecting you to the development server.

You will need to connect it to a backend. For details on our backend, take a look at [its repository](https://github.com/pnblake/emergency-recipe-back).
