    notes: "- If you’re out of green onions, you can substitute them in the sauce with 1 shallot - A good way to use the spice mix is to put it in an empty spice jar and use that to sprinkle it evenly on the lamb chops. - This spice mix is delicious and great on so many things! We've tried it on beef, duck, even carbonara! Might be a good idea to make more than is needed for this dish and keep it around. - If you have sauce leftovers, it keeps well in the fridge for days in an airtight container. It may darken a bit due to the avocado but it still tastes good.",
